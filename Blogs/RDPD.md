### \--excerpts from the book _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ by Robert T. Kiyosaki

Chapter One- LESSON 1: THE RICH DON'T WORK FOR MONEY
----------------------------------------------------

### The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.

#### How to make money work for you?

First of all, make sure you can control your emotions and don't let emotions like fear and greed get the better of you. This is vital because without emotion control you can't think/reason.

Second, work hard to earn money and start investing on assets, not liabilities.

Your assets generates money and now money works for you.

  

Chapter Two- LESSON 2: WHY TEACH FINICIAL LITERACY
--------------------------------------------------

### It's not how much money you make. It's how much money you keep.

#### How do I know how much money I keep?

Learn accounting. Then try to write down your cash-flow (i.e. Income, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities).

  

#### How should I define an asset and a liability

Assets put money in your pocket. Liabilities take money out of your pocket. Buying assets gives you more income whereas buying liabilities gives you more expenses (e.g. House, Car). There is an observation on people's cash flow: poor people only have expenses, middle class people buy liabilities they think are assets. Rich people buy assets.

  

#### OK. so what should I do?

You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets using your income. Assets put money in your pocket so even if you don't work you still earn money (i.e. money works for you now).

  

#### But you can't invest with no money!

That is absolutely true. And that's also the reason why you need to go to school and get good grades. Because you can get a job and earn your income. So when you have money to spare, you can buy assets and make money work for you. Then you don't have to work once you are wealthy.

  

#### How to tell I'm wealthy enough to stop working (retire)?

Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward - or, if I stopped working today, how long can I survive? Once your assets generate enough money to cover your expenses. You can retire!

  

Chapter Three - LESSON 3: MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
------------------------------------------------

### The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements

Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no value once you get them home.

Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a base of solid assets. Let your assets pay for your car, house, and other luxuries.

Real assets fall into the following categories:

1.  _Business that do not require my presence_: I own them, but they are managed or run by other people (e.g. Glazer's Man Utd). If I have to work there, it's not a business. It becomes my job.
2.  _Stocks_
3.  _Bonds_
4.  _Income-generating real estate_
5.  _Notes(IOUs)_
6.  _Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents_
7.  _Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market (Tea leaf)_

Aquire assets you love. If you don't love it, you won't take care of it.

  

Chapter Four - LESSON 4: THE HISTORY OF TAXES AND THE POWER OF CORPORATIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### My rich dad just played the game smart, and he did it through corporations - the biggest secret of the rich

#### Corporations pay taxes as well. How come rich people use it to be richer?

If rich people do not own their corporation, government will take its share first via taxing and the rest will be their true income. The harder they work, the more they need to pay the government. Corporations tax in a slightly different way. Corporations' income will be first used to cover expenses and the left-over will be taxed. What rich people do is that their assets generates income for the corporation, and their expenses become the corporation's expenses. They don't need to have salary. The difference here is that with the same amount of income you can spend more money and pay less tax.

  

#### Darn it! How can I start a corporation?

Garret Sutton's books on corporations provide wonderful insight into the power of personal corporations.

  

#### What else should I learn in order to attain the required knowledge to cope with the tax thing? Or how can I be financial intelligent?

Financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise:  

1.  _Accounting_  
    Accounting is financial literacy or the ability to read numbers. Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements which allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business.
2.  _Investing_
3.  _Understanding markets (Marketing)_  
    Understanding markets is the science of supply and demand. You need to know the technical aspects of the market, which are emotion-driven, in addition to the fundamental or economic aspects of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not make sense based on current market conditions.
4.  _The law_  
    Understand the tax advantages and protections provided by a corporation. Learn about the protection that legal entities can provide for businesses and assets.

  

Chapter Five - LESSON 5: THE RICH INVENT MONEY
----------------------------------------------

### Often in the real world, it's not the smart who get ahead, but the bold

There are two kinds of investors. The first and most common type is a person who buys a packaged investment. They call a retail outlet, such as a real estate company, a stockbroker, or a financial planner, and they buy something. It could be a mutual fund, a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)m a stock or a bond. It is a clean and simple way of investing, An analogy would be a shopper who goes to a computer sotre and buys a computer right off the shelf. The second type is an investor who creates investments. This investor usually assembles a deal in the same way a person who buys components (and) builds a computer. I do not know the first about putting components of a computer together, but I do know how to put pieces of opportunities together, or know people who know how.

It is this second type of investor who is the more professional investor. Sometimes it may take years for all the pieces to come together. And sometimes they never do. It (is) this second type of investor that rich dad encoraged me to be. It is important to learn how to put the pieces together, because that is where the huge wins reside, and sometimes some huge losses if the tide goes against you.

If you want to be the second type of investor, you need to develop three main skills. These skills are in addition to those required to become financially intelligent.

_1\. Find an opportunity that everyone else missed._  
You see with your mind what others miss their eyes. For example, a friend bought this rundown old house. It was spooky to look at. Everyone wondered why he bought it. What he saw that we did not was that the house came with four extra empty lots. He discovered that after going to the title company. After buting the house, he tore the house down and sold the five lots to a builder for three times what he paid for the entire package. He made $75,000 for two months of work. It's not a lot of money, but it sure beats minimum wage. And it's not technically difficult.

_2\. Raise money._  
The average person only goes to the bank. This second type of investor needs to know how to raise capital, and there are many ways that don't require a bank. To get started, I learned how to buy houses without a bank. It was the learned skill of raising money, more than the houses themselves, that was priceless.

All too often I hear people say, "The bank won't lend me money," or "I don't have the money to buy it." If you want ot be a type-two investor, you need to learn how to do that which stops most people. In other words, a majority of people let their lack of money stop them from making a deal. If you can avoid that obstacle, you will be millions ahead of those who don't learn those skills. There have been many times I bought a house, a stock, or an apartment building without a penny in the bank. I once bought an apartment house for $1.2 million. I did what is called "tying it up," with a written contract between seller and buyer. I then raised $100,000 deposit, which bought 90 days to raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because I knew it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money. Instead, the person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000 for finding the deal, took over my position, and I walked away. Total working time: three days. Again, it's what you know more than what you buy. Investing is not buying. It's more a case of knowing.

_3\. Organize smart people._  
Intelligent people are those who work with or hire a person who is more intelligent than they are. When you need advice, make sure you choose your advisor wisely.

There is a lot to learn, but the rewards can be astronomical. If you do not want to learn those skills, then being a type0one investor is highly recommended, It is what you knoe that is your greatest wealth. It is what you do not know that is your greatest risk. There is always risk, so learn to manage risk insetad of avoiding it.

  

Chapter Six - LESSON 6: WORK TO LEARN -- DON'T WORK FOR MONEY
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Job security meant everything to my educated dad. Learning meant everything to my rich dad.

In school and in the workplace, the popular opinion is the idea of specialization: that is, in order to make more money or get promoted, you need to specialize. That is why medical doctors immediately begin to seek a specialty such as orthopedics or pediatrics. The same is tru for accountants, architects, lawyers, pilots, and others. My educated dad believed in the same dogma. That is why he was thrilled hen he eventually achieved his doctorate. He often admitted that schools reward people who study more and more about less and less. Rich dad encouraged to do exactly the opposite. "You want to know a little about a lot" was his suggestion.

#### So what should I do then?

Easy. Find out the skills you need, and learn it.

If you are unwilling to work to learn something new and instead insist on becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the company you work for is unionized. Labor unions are disigned to protect specialists.

Rich dad advised that Mike and I groom ourselves. Many corporations do the same thing (e.g. Huawei), They find a young bright student just out of business school and begin grooming that person to someday take over the company. So these bright young employees do not specialize in one department. They are moved from department to department to leatn all the aspects of business systems. The rich often groom their children or the children of others. By doing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the various departments interrelate.

The main management skills needed for success are: 1. Management of cash flow; 2. Management of systems (e.g. business systems); 3. Management of people (Leadership, which is the most difficult thing to learn). The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing. The ability to sell -- to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child -- is the base skill of personal success. Communication skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success. The better you are at communicating, negotiating, and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is.

Work with people smarter than you are and try to bring smart people together to work as a team.

In addition to being good learners, sellers, and marketers, we need to be good teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to give as well as to receive. the more you give, the more you receive.

  

Chapter Seven - OVERCOMING OBSTACLES
------------------------------------

### The primary difference between a rich person and poor person is how they manage fear.

There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns that could produce a large cash flow. The five reasons are: 1. Fear; 2. Cynicism; 3. Laziness; 4. Bad habits; 5. Arrogance

(To overcome fear, please always have the growth mindset. Embrace failures, defeats and learn from them.)

If you are too afraid of losing money. Start saving money as early as possible.

"Cynics never win," said rich dad. "Unchecked doubt and fear creates a cynic." "Cynics criticize, and winners analyze." "I-don't-wants hold the key to your success." (If you are in doubt and feeling a little afraid, focus on what you want and do it. If it becomes a success. Good! If not, it's also good. Learn from it and you will grow.)

The most common form of laziness is laziness by staying busy. (Staying busy keeps you from facing the problem you have.) The cure for laziness is a little greed, the desire to have something better. Do what you feel in your heart to be right.

  

Chapter Eight - GETTING STARTED
-------------------------------

### There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.

I wish I could say acquiring wealth was easy for me, but is wasn't. So in response to the question "How do I start?" I offer the thought process I go through on a day-to-day basis. It really is easy to find great deals. I promise you that. It's just like riding a bike. After a little wobbling, it's a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it takes determination to get through the wobbling.

I offer you the following 10 steps as a process to develop your God-given powers, powers over which only you have control.

<ol>
    <li>Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit.<br> A reason or a purposr is a combination of "wants" and "don't wants." I will list a few: first, the "don't wants," for they create the "wants", and then the "wants". I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn't. But it wasn't that hard either. I've learned that, without a strong reason or purpose, anything in life is hard.</li><br>
    <li>Make daily choices: the power of choice.<br> Invest first in education. And make sure you really understand what you learn by practising and making mistakes. Listening is more important than talking.</li><br>
    <li>Choose friends carefully: the power of association.<br> One of the hardest things about wealth-building is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd. This is because, in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it's too late in most instances. Look for a new deal. People who hurry and catch a wave late usually are the ones who wipe out. You want to have rich friends because that is where money is made. It's made on information.</li><br>
    <li>Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly.<br> Be careful of what you learn, because your mind is so powerful that you become what you put in your head. In today's fast changing world, it's not so much what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless. It's priceless in finding faster formulas. Working hard for money is an old formula born in the day of cavemen.</li><br>
    <li>Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline.<br> Personal self-discipline is the number-one delineating factor between the rich, the poor, and the middle class. The three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are management of: 1. Cash flow; 2. People; 3. Personal time. Each of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self-discipline. Paying yourself first means allocating money to your asset column before you pay your expenses. To successfully pay yourself first, keep the following in mind: 1. Don't get into large debt positions that you have to pay for. Keep your expenses low. Build up assets first; 2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and don't dip into your savings or investments. Use the pressure to inspire your financial genius to come up with new ways of making more money, and then pay your bills.</li><br>
    <li>Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice.<br> You need to pay professionals well. This is because if people are professionals, their survices should make you money. And the more money they make, the more money I make. We live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good broker should provide you with information, as well as take the time to educate you. A good broker can also save you time. Find a broker who has your best interests at heart. The real people management skill is to manage and reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical area.</li><br>
    <li>Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing.<br> In the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is vital to wealth. The sophisticated investor's first question is: "How fast do I get my money back?" They also want to know what they get for free, also called a "piece of the action." That is why the ROI (return on investment) is so important. Play with money you can afford to lose. On every one of my investments, there must be an upside, something for free -- like a condominimum, a mini-storage, a piece of free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there must be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. So wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at the assets they get for free once they get their money back.</li><br>
    <li>Use assets to buy luxuries, not credits: the power of focus.</li><br>
    <li>Choose heroes: the power of myth.<br> Copying or emulating heroes is true power learning. Heroes make things look easy. Making it look easy convinces us to want to be just like them. When it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard. Find heroes who make it look easy.</li><br>
    <li>Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving.<br> Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets.</li><br>
</ol>
  

  

Chapter Nine - STILL WANT MORE? HERE ARE SOME TO DO's
-----------------------------------------------------

So for those who want a to-do list on how to get started, I will share with you some of the things I do, in abbreviated form.

*   Stop doing what you're doing and assess what is working and what is not working. Stop doing what is not working, and look for something new.
  
*   Look for new ideas. Go to bookstores and search for books on different and unique subjects. These are formulas. Buy how-to books on formulas I know nothing about.
  
*   Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch and ask them for tips and tricks of the trade.
*   Take classes, read, and attend seminars.
  
*   Make lots of offers. (So you can start bargaining and find a good price.)
  
*   Jog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes. Do so to look for bargains and more important, changes.
  
*   Shop for bargains in all markets. Profits are made in the buying, not the selling.
  
*   Look in the right places. For example, look for people who want to buy first. Then look for someone who wants to sell. Doing so can help you get discounts because you have a large demand. Think big.
  
*   Learn from history.
  
*   Action always beats inaction
  

  

FINAL THOUGHTS
--------------

It's what is in your head that determines what is in your hands. Money is only an idea. You can take a look at _Think and Grow Rich_.

There are three different types of income in the world of accounting: 1. Ordinary earned; 2. Portfolio; 3. Passive. Passive income, in most cases, is income derived from real estate investments. Portfolio income is income derived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds. The key to becoming wealthy is the ability to convert earned income into passive income or portfolio income as quickly as possible. Taxes are highest on earned income. The least-taxed income is passive income. That is another reason why you want your money working hard for you. The government taxes the income you work hard for more than the income your money works hard for.
