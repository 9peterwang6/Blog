UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Prevention Training for Staff
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### PART 1: Avoiding Harassing Behavior

Types of Sexual Harassment:

*   Quid Pro Quo (Meaning "this for that" in Latin)
    *   Quid Pro Quo is usually commited by an individual in a higher position of power
    *   Quid Pro Quo propositions are illegal even if the target unwillingly agrees to them
    *   But if sexual contact is mutually desired, then it is not harassment
*   Hostile Environment
    *   A hostile work environment occurs where unwelcome conduct based on ptotected characteristics interferes with an individual's ability to perform their job.
    *   Protected characteristics include: race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or generic characteristics), marital status, gender or gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, preganancy or related medical conditions, military & veteran status
    *   the hostile conduct may be: verbal (jokes, offensive language threats, name calling, slur), physical (unwanted touching, holding, blocking someone's way) and non-verbal (offensive gestures, images, letters or emails)
    *   A single isolated incident is unlikely to constitute a hostile work environment. The inappropriate conduct must be sufficiently severe or sufficiently pervasive. A one-time event may be severe enough to be harassement especially if it involved physical contact.
*   Pervasive harassment involves conduct that occurs frequently and over a long period of time.
*   Harassment is illegal no matter who commits it. And it is the employer's responsibility to take reasonable steps to address the situation and prevent it from happening again

### PART 2: Avoiding Hostile Conduct

Hostile conduct is malicious behaviour by an employer or employee in the workplace that a reasonable person would find: hostile, unrelated to business or offensive:

*   Examples of hostile conduct include: repeated verbal hostility; threatening, intimidating or humiliating physical or verbal conduct; gratuitous undermining of work performance, gratuitous sabotage of work product
*   A single act is unlikely to be hostile conduct unless it is especially severe and egregious
*   Hostile conduct hurts the targets of the abuse, teams, and the entire organization

Report to Title IX office promptly if you feel you need to.

### PART 3: Crimes and Conduct Violations

#### Consent and the Law

Under California law defining sex offenses, consent means an informed, voluntary, and affirmative decision to engage in sexual activity, which cannot be given by someone who is:

*   unconscious, asleep, or incapacitated by drugs or alcohol
*   unable to understand the nature of the activity due to a mental, physical, or developmental disability
*   forced, threatened, or coerced
*   under age (generally, the age of consent is 18)
*   In addition, asking the perpetrator to use a condom or other birth control device does not imply consent.

#### Affirmative Consent

In campus disciplinary proceedings involving sexual assault, California colleges and universities must use an "affirmative consent" standard to decide responsibility, which is defined as an affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. In applying this standard, California law provides these guidelines:

*   consent may be withdrawn at any time
*   the other person's silence or lack of protest or resistance does not show consent
*   a current dating relationship or past sexual relations with the accused does not necessarily mean consent was given

In addition, the accused cannot avoid responsibility for failing to obtain consent if he or she:

*   was intoxicated or acted recklessly
*   did not take steps to get the other person's consent
*   knew or should have known that the complainant was: (A) asleep or unconscious, (B) incapacitated due to drugs, alcohol, or medication, or (C) unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition

#### Relationship Violence

When one partner hurts or tries to control or dominate the other partner, it is abusive behavior. Abuse takes a variety of forms and is not just physical:

*   Physical: Causing bodily harm (e.g. hitting, choking, grabbing) or committing sexual assault (e.g. coercing, manipulating, or drugging someone In order to force sexual activities upon them)
*   Emotional: Manipulating someone with guilt or fear (e.g. threatening to harm the partner or their children or pets), or isolating them from friends and family.
*   Technological: Sending unwanted messages via text, email, or voicemail; spying on or tracking someone through their computer or mobile devices; breaking into their social media accounts.
*   Verbal: Belittling, humiliating, insulting, or spreading rumors about someone.

#### Domestic Violence

California law defines domestic violence as abusive behavior between two people who:

*   have dated, married, or lived together
*   have a child in common
*   are related by blood or marriage
*   are parent and child

Domestic and dating abuse can be spoken, written, or physical, and includes:

*   sexual assault
*   actual or attempted physical injury
*   causing fear of imminent serious bodily injury
*   threatening, harassing, stalking, disturbing their peace, or destroying their personal property
*   emotional abuse, financial or property control, or other coercive and controlling behaviors

#### Stalking

Under California law, stalking is defined as repeatedly following someone or engaging in a course of conduct that seriously alarms a person, and threatening to hurt them or a member of their immediate family or household.

The crime of cyberstalking involves annoying or harassing someone with repeated calls or electronic communications that are obscene or threatening.

It is also a crime to use an electronic device to distribute personal information about or digital images of someone with the intent to harass or harm that person.

If a student suspects that they are being stalked, you should refrain from advising them and instead refer them to the Title IX Office or a CARE Advocate. If they are in immediate danger, contact the police or campus authorities.

#### Victim Protections

Different types of protective orders are issued by California courts:

*   Restraining orders prohibit intimate partners from contacting, hurting, or threatening victims of domestic or dating abuse, and also protect members of the victim's family or household.
*   Police officers responding to domestic or dating violence calls may obtain emergency protective orders which are effective immediately and stay in effect for a week to allow time for a court hearing on a restraining order.
*   Harassment orders protect victims of violence, harassment, stalking, or credible threats of violence (whether or not the victim is related to or knows the perpetrator), and also protect members of the victim's immediate family.
*   Witness protection orders prohibit perpetrators of domestic violence and other crimes from intimidating, threatening, harming, or contacting witnesses and their immediate families.

A person who violates a protective order may go to jail. Local and campus police departments enforce these orders (including orders issued by a judge in another state), provided they have a copy of the order, so victims should carry a copy of the order with them at all times. It is out job to be an active by-stander who watches out for misconduct and speak out.

There may be some barriers that stop you from speaking out. Here are the barriers and what you should be thinking:

*   In/Out Groups: They don't look like students, so what can I do? But it's happening on campus, so it affects me.
*   Role Morality: It isn't my job to do anything. But as a part of our community, I have a duty to keep our campus safe.
*   Diffusion of Responsibility: There are lots of people around. Someone else will take care of it: Everyone is telling themselves the same thing, so I better be the one to act.

Use the following techinques to address ptoblematic behaviours or to step into a situation that looks like it might get out of hand.

*   Appeal to Friendship: I know it's not your intention, but I think your words are making people feel unsafe. Want to talk about it over coffee later?
*   Speak Only for Yourself: It makes me uncomfortable when you make racial jokes.
*   Distract: If you see someone harassing another person, for instance, you might ask them for the time or tell them their car is being towed. "Excuse me, do either of you have the time?"
*   Appeal to Empathy: How might you feel if someone put down your work because of the way you look?
*   Try Using Humor: Only do this if you feel comfortable with it. Humor can cut tension in a rough situation, but it's important that you don't trivialize the bad behavior or mock your own reactions to it. "Maybe it's because I didn't have coffee this morning, but I'm pretty confused about why you're showing us this."
*   Find Support: Stepping in can be easier with support. For example, if you see a fight on campus, it might be safer to call campus security.
*   Stare: If you can't verbally step in, make sure that the offender knows that you are a witness to their behavior. A long stare might be all that is necessary to stop something bad from happening.

### PART 4: Respomsible Employees

#### Who is a "Responsible Employee"?

Title IX requires each University to identify “responsible employees” as any employee who:

*   has the authority to take action to redress sexual harassment/misconduct;
*   has been given the duty of reporting incidents of sexual harassment/misconduct or any other misconduct by students to the Title IX coordinator or other appropriate designee; or
*   a student reasonably believes has this authority or duty.

#### Duties of Responsible Employees

As a responsible employee you must:

*   inform the person before they disclose an incident that you are obligated to report details to the Title IX Office (or designee)
*   inform the person that the campus has confidential resources and support including the CARE advocates, Title IX, Counseling Service, and the Campus Police (as appropriate)
*   report—as soon as practically possible—all the details you know to the Title IX Office (or designee)

As a responsible employee you must NOT:

*   try to investigate a complaint. That is Title IX’s responsibility.
*   try to intervene and resolve the issue. Title IX will work with appropriate offices to resolve.
*   promise confidentiality. You are not a confidential resource.
*   share information with anyone else who does not have a legitimate need to know. While you must report, it is important to maintain privacy when possible.

#### What do I have to report to Title IX?

When you report a real or possible incident of sexual violence/sexual harassment you will need to provide as much detail as you have and/or were given. Title IX might ask you for:

*   name(s) of complainant and any other identified parties
*   how you heard about the incident
*   what you were told
*   any contact information you have for the complainant(s)
*   any other relevant information that was shared with you or that you already know including the name of the respondent (if known)

#### What do I do when someone reports to me?

*   Address immediate safety of the complainant if necessary
*   Be empathetic
*   Just listen
*   Do not investigate, question, or probe—this is the responsibility of Title IX
*   Clarify your next steps: “Thank you for sharing with me. I'm going to send this information to the Title IX office, they might be contacting you in the near future regarding what you shared with me today. Remember, if you should need anything, there are several resources here on campus.”
*   Provide confidential resources such as CARE, the Counseling Center, FSAP, etc.
*   Refrain from expressing judgment or predicting or promising any outcome.

**BOTTOM LINE**: Provide support, listen, provide resources. Don’t act except to report to Title IX if warranted. Do not promise confidentiality.

#### Barriers to reporting and how to break it down

*   Self-Doubt: Provide reassurance that some victims have lapses in memory or are uncertain whether what happened is serious enough to report; they should be encouraged to talk to a counselor or victim advocate about their experience or feelings about what happened.
*   Too Personal: Remind students that they have the option to make confidential disclosures to a licensed confidential counselor or other confidential resource if they feel uncomfortable talking to you about it, or are unsure if they want to report it.
*   Social Isolation: Sexual assault is most often committed by someone the survivor knows, and often someone in their social circle. Survivors risk social ostracism by speaking out. Connecting survivors with the appropriate campus resources can help protect them against reprisals or retaliation.
*   Victim Blaming: Victim blaming is a major barrier to reporting. Reassure the victim that it's not their fault. Avoid asking speculative or interrogatory questions. It is not your job to investigate or make judgments about what happened. Asking these questions can make a victim feel that you're blaming them for what happened. And intervene if you hear others victim blaming.

#### How to talk to survivors?

*   By providing the student with all the information up front, you allow them to make the best choice for themselves. It’s important to give survivors of sexual assault as much control over their situation as possible.
*   By repeating the student’s own language, you show that you’re listening closely to them. Validating their emotional response shows that you are not judging them.
*   It’s appropriate to remind the student that talking about the event takes courage and to verbally support them through the process.
*   "I want to stress that what happened to you was in no way your fault"
*   "It's unfortunate that you had to go through that"
*   It’s important to support the victim’s survival instincts, regardless of whether it fits your idea of the right response. "You did what you needed to do in the situation".

Just because the survivor didn't react yhe way you expect, doesn't mean the survivor is lying.
