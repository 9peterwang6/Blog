	<p>Today I came across an interesting problem: Suppose you have to do a multiple choice question and you have three choices A, B, and C. You randomly picked A. Then the professor, who made up the question and knew the answer, told you that choice C was wrong and asked if you wanted to change your mind. Should you change your mind?</p>
	<p>The problem actually reminds me of Monty Hall Problem, which I first saw it on the "extracurriculum info" (forgot the name of that section already) of my high school math book of practice problems. I didn't recall the details of the reasoning but I did remember I have to switch my choice to take the the luxurious car home. So by the same token, you should switch your choice to get that question right. But how come?</p>
	<p>After looking it up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Wikipedia</a>, I have got some basic understanding of the problem and an initial explanation as to why I should switch my choice. I found the following table very useful. You randomly picked A and here are the possible outcomes.</p>
	<div class="w3-responsive">
		<table class="w3-table w3-black w3-hoverable">
			<tr>
				<th>Is A correct?</th>
				<th>Is B correct?</th>
				<th>Is C correct?</th>
				<th>Which choice can prof. indicate incorrect?</th>
				<th>If you don't switch from A</th>
				<th>If you switch</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Yes</th>
				<th>No</th>
				<th>No</th>
				<th>B or C</th>
				<th>You get it right</th>
				<th>You get it wrong</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>No</th>
				<th>Yes</th>
				<th>No</th>
				<th>C</th>
				<th>You get it wrong</th>
				<th>You get it right</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>No</th>
				<th>No</th>
				<th>Yes</th>
				<th>B</th>
				<th>You get it wrong</th>
				<th>You get it right</th>
			</tr>
		</table>

	<p>From your perspective, you randomly pick a choice, and you know that it will only have one-third of probability to get it right. Now the interesting part kicks in. The professor KNOWS THE ANSWER and he can't tell you. He can only tell you one of the incorrect choices and that choice can't be your choice, which in two-thirds of the cases he can only pick one choice to tell you it's incorrect. So in these cases if you switch your choice you will get it right. The only case that switching will land you on the wrong answer is when you randomly get it right in the first place. And the professor can now randomly pick one choice and tell you it's incorrect.</p>
	<p>To make it more concise, you randomly pick a choice, the probability that you guess it right is one-third. You will definitely know an incorrect choice from professor. If you switch you miss. The probability that you guess it wrong is two-thirds. You will definite know an incorrect choice from professor. If you switch you get it right. So if you switch, the probablity of you getting it right is now two-thirds.</p>
	<p>But hey! This is counterintuitive! You don't normally think that way. When professor tells you that another choice is wrong. You gain confidence in your guess and now it doesn't matter whether you switch your choice or not. You get equally likely results! Well... you WILL end up having equally likely results no matter what you do. BUT you need to change the situation a bit: the professor doesn't know the answer now. So now, after you make your initial guess, you will find yourself end up in the following situations:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You choose the correct answer and the professor tells you one incorrect choice</li>
		<li>You choose the incorrect answer and the professor tells you one incorrect choice</li>
		<li>You choose the incorrect answer and the professor tells you the correct choice<li>
	</ol>
	<p>In case 3 you don't need to switch and you have got it wrong. You can't do anything. And switching doesn't do you any good here.</p>
	<p>So the takeaway here is: sometimes you think it's random when it's not, and sometimes you think it's not random when it is. Don't trust your intuition...</p>
	<p>just my thoughts... right or wrong :)</p>
