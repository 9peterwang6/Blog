			<p>First of all, this blog was mainly based on the contents from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBTmNm8D-84">Consumer Reports' Understanding Your Health Insurance Costs</a> video. If you feel like the blog is too long for you to read, please click on the link above to jump directly to the video.</p>

			<p>Suppose you don't have a personal health insurance in the US; and you want to purchase one so that an insurance company can cover some of the expenses when you visit a medical doctor. To buy a personal health insurance for a certain period of time say one year, you need to pay a "subscription fee" monthly just like the way you subscribe a monthly newsletter. This "subscription fee" is called Premium. Paying the Premium comes with some benefits. Your insurance company pays all the costs for certain health care services like immunization, screening, or other preventive care.</p>
			
			<p>If you need to have the other health care services, you need to know its cost. Suppose the service you want will cost you X dollars if you go without an insurance. Here are some possible conditions.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>(X + (the amount you have paid previously for Deductible)) is smaller or equal to Deductible. In this case, you will need to pay X dollars and your insurance company pays 0. Here Deductible is the amount of money you need to pay before your insurance company covers some of the expenses. The Deductible is accumulative for the period of time you bought the insurance for. So if you previously have paid for some other medical expenses smaller than your Deductible, the amount will be recorded; and your insurance company will keep track of the total amount of money you paid from out of your pocket so the next time you visit your doctor you will pay less to let your insurance company share your cost.</li><br>
				<li>
					(X + (the amount you have paid previously for Deductible)) is greater than Deductible. In this case, your insurance company will cover some of your expense. You will still need to pay a certain share of the expense. This is called your Copay or Coinsurance. Your insurance company covers the rest of the cost. But that's not it! To determine the exact amount you need to pay, we need to factor in the Out-of-pocket maximum of your insurance. The Out-of-pocket maximum is the maximum amount of money you will need to pay from out of your pocket for the entire period of your insurance. There are two possible conditions in this case.<br>
					<ul>
						<li>(Deductible + Copay + (the amount you have paid previously for other Copay)) is smaller or equal to Out-of-pocket maximum. In this case the exact amount you need to pay is: (Deductible - (the amount you have paid previously for Deductible) + Copay) dollars. Your insurance company will pay (X - Copay - (Deductible - (the amount you have paid previously for Deductible))) dollars.</li>
						<li>(Deductible + Copay + (the amount you have paid previously for other Copay)) is greater than Out-of-pocket maximum. In this case the exact amount you need to pay is: (Out-of-pocket maximum - (the amount you have paid previously for other Copay) - (the amount you have paid previously for Deductible)) dollars. Your insurance company will pay (X - Out-of-pocket maximum) dollars.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>To summarize, a personal health insurance has 4 attributes you need to pay attention to: Premium, Deductible, Copay and Out-of-pocket maximum. Remember to first determine your health condition and use a decision matrix to decide which health care insurance you need to buy.</p>
