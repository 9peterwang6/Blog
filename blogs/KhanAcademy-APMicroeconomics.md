My notes on Khan Academy's AP Microeconomics course

### Section One: Basic Economic Concepts

Economics can be divided into two fields: micro and macro economics. Microeconomics is the study of individuals who make decisions out of self-interests. It stidies how they should allocate scarce resources (make decisions) based on the status of the current market. Individuals can be a person, a company or a household. Macroeconomics is study of the aggregated impact of individuals' decisions. It studies how to adjust the market (what policies to carry out) based on the individuals' impact. Note that a strong assumption is made. That is individuals make decisions out of self-interests, which may not be always true. With this assumption we can use math to show how to make decisions. But since the assumption is not always true, the conclusions may not always be valid. That may account for the fact that most macroeconomic predictions are not happening. So we should always take the predictions with a grain of salt and always check the assumptions economists make.

Scarcity is the reason why we need to study economics. Most of the resources we have are scarce. Here scarce means that there is only a limited amount of that resource. So we have to allocate it wisely in exchange for other scarce resource we need. If one can take home a resource without exchanging some scarce resources and one's usages of the resource doesn't affect others' usages of the resource, then this resource is a free resource.

Some scarce resources are reproducable, so to overcome the scarcity of some resources we need to produce it. These resources are: capital (tools, machinary, money) and consumer goods. To produce these resources, we need to have the following four factors:

*   Land (natural resources)
*   Labor (human resources)
*   Capital
*   Entrepreneurship (the ability to organize the above resources; organization)

Note that Capital can be used to produce captial and consumer goods. We can think about how to allocate the resources we have to produce capital and consumer goods to satify our own demands of different scarce resources.

The way to study resource allocation is to build up a math model or an experiment model. It is ideal to model real world situations. But reality is too complicated to model. So we need to simplify things until managable. To simplify things we use assumptions. In economics, we assume that each agent who participates in resource allocation is rational. That way we can exclude situations where people are not acting rationally. To study what factor may influence resource allocation, we need to use an assumption named "ceteris paribus", which means "all else equal" in latin. That way we can control the variables to make sure there is only one variable that can be changed each time. So we are able to see exactly how this change of variable can impact other variables.

When we draw conclusions from the modeling results, economics prefer positive statements to normative statements. Here are the definitions of the two statements:

*   Normative statement: Opinions. Examples: Something is fair/good/bad. One should do something.
*   Positive statement: Statements that can be validated. Examples: Doing exercise is good for one's health. Smoking is bad for health. Raising tax on the wealthy grows the economy.

Let's start building a model of your production. Assume that you have 8 hours of time to catch rabbits and harvest berries. The following list shows different scenarios of what you end up having ON AVERAGE after you spend ALL of your 8 hours catching rabbits or harvesting berries:

*   Scenario A: 5 rabbits, 0 berry
*   Scenario B: 4 rabbits, 100 berries
*   Scenario C: 3 rabbits, 180 berries
*   Scenario D: 2 rabbits, 240 berries
*   Scenario E: 1 rabbit, 280 berries
*   Scenario F: 0 rabbit, 300 berries

When we plot the above scenarios onto a 2D graph, we will end up having a Production Possibilities Curve (PPC). This curve can show you what you can do if you spend all of your time resource in catching rabbits and harvesting berries on average (allocate your time resource to produce scarce resources rabbits and berries for you). In fact, data points on the PPC are what you can do when you are most efficient. Data points on the right side of the PPC is not possible to achieve unless you somehow have more than 8 hours or you improve your skills. Data points on the left hand side of the PPC and in the first quadrant are possible. But they are not optimal in the sense that when you achieve it you are not doing your best, or not efficient because you are not spending all your time catching rabbits and harvesting berries and you can do more.

One interesting to point out is that when you want to increase the number of one resource you want to get, you have to do it by "sacrificing" another resource can get. For example, you can get 1 rabbit and 280 berries on average when you spend all of your 8 hours. Now you want to get 2 rabbits, then you need to spend more time on catching rabbits and you end up having 240 berries on average after all your 8 hours have been spent.If you can get 1 rabbit and 100 berries and some time for leisure. Now you want to have more berries and rabbits, then you have less time for leisure.We call these sacrifice "Opportunity Cost". When you need to sacrifice X (X > 0) units of resource A to get Y(Y > 0) units of resource B, your opportunity cost for getting Y units of B is X units of A. Then to get 1 unit of B, your opportunity cost is (Y/X) units of A. This type of opportunity cost is called "Marginal Cost". Here we can notice that if you spend all your time getting food, the more rabbits you want to get, the more berries you need to give up, which means the opportunity cost of getting one more rabbit increases as the total number of rabbits you want increases. There are cases where the opportunity cost remain constant or even decreases.

Let's say you took courses on how to catch rabbits effectively and how to harvest berries efficiently. Now you are able to catch more rabbits and harvest more berries; and your PPC becomes a straight line (y = -(5/300) \* x + 10 with y being the number of rabbits and x the number of berries). And you have a friend Peter who also catches rabbits and harvests berries. His PPC is also a straight line (y = -(1/20) \* x + 15). Since both you and Peter have a linear PPC, the opportunity costs for catching more rabbits or harvesting more berries remain constant for you and Peter. With some calculations we can find out the following:

*   For you, the opportunity cost for catching one more rabbit is harvesting 60 berries; the opportunity cost for harvesting one more berry is catching (1/60) rabbit.
*   For Peter, the opportunity cost for carching one more rabbit is harvesting 20 berries; the opportunity cost for harvesting one more berry is catching (1/20) rabbit.

We can see that you have a less opportunity cost for harvesting berry compared to Peter's; and Peter has a less opportunity cost for catching one more rabbit compared to yours. We will say that you have a comparative advantage over Peter in harvesting berries and Peter has a comparative advantage over you in catching rabbits. Notice that when you spend all your time harvesting berries, you will harvest more berries than Peter can. That shows you have an absolute advantage in harvesting berries over Peter.

Given that Peter has a comparative advantage in catching rabbits and you have a comparative advantage in harvesting berries, there is one way to let both you and Peter become more efficient than before, meaning you and Peter can all get beyond your own PPC. And that is trading. Here trading means exchanging resources. If you spend all your time harvesting berries and Peter spend all his time catching rabbits, you will have 600 berries and Peter will have 15 rabbits at the end of the day. When you and Peter agree to trade 4 rabbits for 200 berries, you will have 400 berries and 4 rabbits; Peter will have 200 berries and 11 rabbits. After the trade, you are more efficient than before because when x = 400, y ~= 3.33 in your PPC but now you have 4 rabbits. Peter is more efficient as well because when y = 11, x = 80 in his PPC but now he has 200 berries. Both you and Peter have gains from trade in this case. However, not every trade results in gains for both parties. To make sure a trade will do good to both parties, the trade should satisfy the following conditions:

*   Comparative advantage should exist for both parties so that each party will focus on producing one resource for trading.
*   The trading plan should make sure that both parties get the resource they want at a cost lower than their own opportunity cost for producing it.

With the above conditions satified, both parties will focus on producing the scarce resource they have comparative advantage on and use the resource to trade for the other resource they want. Producing the resource they don't have comparative advantage on is not wise because it has a higher opportunity cost compared to trading.

With the notion of opportunity cost, we can better explain the reason behind the assumptions in economic models. An very important assumption in economics is that each agent who participates in resource allocation is rational. But how to be rational? When we do resource allocation, we will have benefits associated with our decision. The benefit may be happiness, revenue. The decision also comes with costs. There are two types of costs: explicit cost (e.g. fees, expenses) and implicit cost (e.g. opportunity cost). To be a rational decision maker in economics, we need to maximize (benefit - cost).

Another way to think of rationality is to use the concept of utility maximization. We want to allocate resources to have the maximum total utility. Utility is a measure of satisfaction. A single utility value does not mean anything because it's up to you to decide how big it is. But if more than two utility values are specified, we can make use of these numbers because they are from the same "reference frame" which is you.

Here is an example: suppose you want to spend money on chocolate bars and fruits. To determine the number of chocolate bars and the amount of fruits you want to buy, you list your marginal utility, which is the utility you get from buying an incremental unit of consumer good, when buying them:

*   For chocolate bars:
    *   buying the first bar has a margnial utility of 100
    *   buying the second second bar has a marginal utility of 80
    *   buying the third bar has a marginal utility of 60
    *   buying the fourth bars has a marginal utility of 40
    *   buying the fifth bars has a marginal utility of -10
*   For fruits:
    *   buying the first pound has a marginal utility of 120
    *   buying the second pound has a marginal utility of 100
    *   buying the third pound has a marginal utility of 50
    *   buying the fourth pound has a marginal utility of 20

Now you only have 5 dollars. Buying a chocolate bar costs 1 dollar; buying a pound of fruits costs you 2 dollars. How are you going to allocate your money to buy chocolate bars and fruits so that you have the optimal amount of total utility? We will first calculate the marginal utility per dollar. Here is what we get:

*   For chocolate bars:
    *   buying the first bar has a margnial utility per dollar of 100
    *   buying the second bar has a marginal utility per dollar of 80
    *   buying the third bar has a marginal utility per dollar of 60
    *   buying the fourth bar has a marginal utility per dollar of 40
    *   buying the fifthe bar has a marginal utility per dollar of -10
*   For fruits:
    *   buying the first pound has a marginal utility per dollar of 60
    *   buying the second pound has a marginal utility per dollar of 50
    *   buying the third pound has a marginal utility per dollar of 25
    *   buying the fourth pound has a marginal utility per dollar of 10

We can see that buying the first bar of cholocate can give us the highest utility per dollar. So we will purchase one bar of cholocate with dollar. After that, we have 4 dollars left and we can see that buying the second bar of cholocate has the highest utility per dollar. So we will spend one dollar in buying another chocolate bar. After this purchase, we have 3 dollars left and we find that buying the third bar of chocolate or buying the first pound of fruits can give us the highest utility per dollar. Since we have enough money to buy the third chocolate or buy the first pound of fruits. We can choose either of the two and we choose to buy the third bar of chocolate bar. Since we still have enough money to buy a pound of fruit, and buying the first pound of fruit gives us the highest utility per dollar after purchasing the third bar of cholocate, the next move we will do is to buy a pound of fruit and we have all five dollars spent optimally on fruits and chocolate bars.

When using the concept of utility to allocate resources,  a rational way of doing it is to maximize the total utility we can have. Here we use a "greedy" method that is maximizing the marginal utility per dollar for each incremental allocation. And this principle is demonstrated in the above examples. To prove the principle really provides optimal result, check out the solution fractional knapsack problem. Using this method will have the following pattern: When the resource allocation scheme reaches a point where marginal utility per dollar is the same between the products you can choose, you will buy one product first and the other later, and the cycle continues until you run out of money. 

What if you have 5 dollars to spend only on chocolate bars? In this case we will not be spending all the money. We will only buy 4 bars of chocolate bars to attain maximum total utility. Because when buying the fifth bar we will have minus marginal utility per dollar and thus a smaller total utility than when buying the fourth chocolate bar.

### Section Two: Supply And Demand

Recall from Section one that we need to allocate the resource we have in hand to produce capital and consumer goods to satisfy our own demand of scarce resources. With the resources we produce, we can exchange/trade/buy resources/consumer goods with others to satify our demand. The place we do trading is the market. The market guarantees each of us one property rights so that our ownership to the product we own is exclusive (no one else can claim ownership of it unless we pass our ownership to him) , enforceable (our ownership is protected; anyone who tries to break it will be punished) and transferable (we can pass our ownership of some resource to somebody else). When you do a trading (e.g. trade 4 rabbits for 200 berries), the resource you own now has a price (e.g. one rabbit is worth fifty berries). And a change of price of your resource or others' resource will affect your demand or supply of a scarce resource.

In microeconomics, we have a law of demand, which says that if the price of a resource goes up, the quantity demanded will go down; if the price of a resource goes down, the quantity demanded will go up. This law can be explained using marginal utility. Recall from Section one that when we decide what to buy, we calculate the marginal utility per dollar and decide to buy the item that has the highest marginal utility per dollar. When the proce of an item goes down, its marginal utility per dollar becomes higher, which will make people more tempting to buy this item. Using the chocolate and fruit example from section one, if the price of a bar of chocolate drops to 0.5 dollar, then we will end up buying 4 bars of cholocate instead of 3. So the quantity demanded for chocolate increases from 3 to 4 after the price drop. In this example we are the only buyer of chocolate bars and fruit. In reality the quantity demanded of one item will be the sum of the quantity demanded for the item from all buyers.

If we plot the price and quantity demanded for chocolate bars in a 2D graph, we will end up having a demand curve for chocolate bars. If the price of a chocolate bar changes, we will end up being at a different data point on the same demand curve. What if other products have their prices changed?

Price change of related products may also affect the demand curve of the product you want to buy. It will result in a shift of demand curve. For example, fruit is the subsitute of chocolate bars, meaning that if you buy fruits, you will not buy chocolate bars, or vise versa. If the price per pound fruit drops to 1 dollar while the price per chocolate bar stays at 1 dollar, then we will buy 3 pounds of fruit instead of one pound and we will buy two bars of chocolate instead of 3 bars.

In fact, given product A and its substitute B. if the price of B drops, then the quantity demanded for A will go down no matter what price it is currently at. This will result in a left shift of its demand curve. If the price of B goes up, then the quantity demanded for A will go up no matter what price it is currently at. This will result in a right shift of its demand curve.

There is another situation, that is product B is a compliment of A, which means if you want to buy A, you will also need to buy B and vise versa. An example will be A is an e-book and B is a kindle. In this case, if price of B drops, then the quantity demanded for B will go up. Because buying B requires buying A, the quantity demanded for A will go up no matter what price it is currently at. This will result in a right shift ot A's demand curve. If price of B goes up, then the quantity demanded for B will go down. Since buying B requires buying A, the quantity demanded for A will also go down no matter waht price it is currently at. This will result in a left shift of A's demand curve.

The final situation is that A and B are not related. In this case, if price of B changes, there will be no impact on A's demand curve.

You may notice that given different product A and B, when price of B changes, A's demand curve may shift. A shift of demand curve is called a change of demand. It changes the quantity demanded at all prices of a product.

There are other factors that can shift the demand curve. Here are some of the possible factors:

*   If people expect the future price of product A will go up, they will buy more product A whatever the current price is at, then the demand curve of A will shift to the right. If people expect the future price of A will go down, they will buy less product A no matter what price A is at, then the demand curve of A will shift to the left.
*   If personal income increases, the demand curve shifts to the right; if personal income decreases, the demand curve shifts to the left. There is a caveat. This pattern will only work on normal goods. If a product A is an inferior good, meaning that people would rather not own this good when they have more money, when personal incomes goes up, A's demand curve shifts to the left, when personal income goes down, A's demand curve shifts to the right.
*   If population grows, the demand curve shifts to the right, if population shrinks, the demand curve shifts to the left.
*   If personal preference to product A goes up, the demand curve of product A shufts to the right. If personal preference to product A goes down, the demand curve of A shifts to the left.

If we view the market from producers' perspective, we have the law of supply. Given all else equal, if the price of product A goes up, the quantity produced goes up, if the price of product A comes down, the quantity produced comes down.  It's easy to explain. Given the price of product A goes up, producers will have more incentive to produce product A, so the quantity produced goes up. A decrease in price of product A gives producers less incentive to produce product A, so the quantity produced goes down.

Similar to the law of demand, there are factors thay can change the supply of product A, meaning that the supply curve of product A gets shifted. Here are some of them:

*   Cost of production: if the cost of production of product A goes up, the supply of A goes down and the supply curve of product A shifts to the left. If the cost of production of product A goes down, the supply of A goes up, and thw supply curve of A shifts to the right.
*   Price of other things to produce: if a producer can only produce product A and product B. If the price of product B goes up, the supply of A goes down because the producer has more incentive to produce B. The supply curve of A shifts to the left. If the price of B goes down, then the producer has less incentive to produce B, so he may turn to producing A. And the supply of A increases. The supply curve of A shifts to the right.
*   The number of producers producing A: if the number of producers producing A goes up, the supply of A goes up, the supply curve of A shifts to the right. If the number of producers producing A goes down, the supply of A goes down, and the supply curve of A shifts to the left.
*   The expected future price of product A: if the expected future price of product A goes down, then the supply of A goes up and the supply curve of A shifts to the right. This is because in the future we will be earning less by producing A, we need to try to sell all the product A we have as soon as possible so we dump product A to the market and the supply of A goes up. If the expected future price goes up, then we don't need to sell A too early, we can hoard it and sell it later to earn more. So the supply of A goes down and the supply curve of A shifts to the left.
*   Technology: If technology of producing product A improves, then the cost of producing A goes down, so the supply of A goes up, and the supply curve of A shifts to the right.

We can see from the above that with the demand and supply curve it is easier for us to visualize the law of demand and the law of supply. With these two graphs, we can also determine the elasticity of demand and the elasticity of supply.

Price elasticity of demand is defined as follows: given two data points A(aq, ap) and B(bq, bp) on a demand curveof product X, elasticity from A to B E(A,B) is ((bq - aq)/aq) / ((bp - ap)/ap), meaning the percentage change of quantity demanded over the percentage change of price. If the absolute value of E(A,B) is greater than 1, then we say X's demand is elastic from A to B. If the absolute value of E(A,B) is smaller that 1, then we say X's demand is inelastic from A to B. If the absolute value of E(A,B) is equal to 1, then we say X's demand has a unitary elasticity from A to B. If the absolute value of E(A,B) is equal to infinity, then we say X's demand is perfectly elastic from A to B. If the absolute value of E(A,B) is equal to 0, then we say X's demand is perfectly inelastic from A to B.

You may notice that E(A,B) may not be equal to E(B,A). There is one way to let E(A,B) = E(B,A). That is using the midpoint method. Using midpoint method, the calculation of E(A,B) becomes ((bq - aq)/((aq + bq)/2)) / ((bp - ap)/((ap + bp)/2)). Midpoint method comes with a drawback, the farther the two datapoints, the less meaning the result will have because the mid point is also far away from the datapoints. Economists came up with another way to compute elasticity which is the point method. If we set datapoint A is the initial point, then point B's elasticity = E(A,B).

As always, there are some factors that can influence the elasticity of demand:

*   The number of subsitutes: the more substitutes, the more elastic.
*   Timeframe: the longer the timespan, the less elastic.
*   Income share: the percentage of income which the price of a product consists of is called the income share. The higher the income share, the more elastic.
*   Luxury vs. necessity: if the product is considered as a luxury, then it has more elasticity. It the product is considered necessity, then it has less elasticity.
*   Narrowness of the market: consider the market of smartphone and the market of phone. The market of smartphone is narrower than the market of phone because the latter consists of other type of phones. The narrower the market, the more elastic.

The price elasticity of demand has something to do with the total revenue. Given two data points A and B on a demand curve of product X, if |E(A,B)| is greater than 1, then when we lower the price of X in between A and B, we end up having a larger total revenue. If |E(A,B)| is equal to 1, then when we lower the price of X in between A and B, we end up having the same total revenue. If |E(A,B)| is less than 1, then we end up having less revenue if we lower the price of X.

Similar to the price elastucity of demand, we also have the price elasticity of supply. It measures the percentage change of quantity supplied over the percentage change of price.

Here are the factors that can impact the price elasticity of supply:

*   Timeframe: the longer the timespan, the more elastic.
*   Available resources: the more available resources, the more elastic.

There are other types of elasticities:

*   Income elasticity of demand: percentage change of quantity demanded of one good / percentage change of income. If income elasticity of product A is positive when income increases, then product A is a normal good. If income elasticity of product A is negative when income increases, then product A is an inferior good.
*   Cross elasticity of demand (CED): percentage change of quantity demanded of product A / percentage change of price of product B. It can be used to determine the relation between product A and product B. Note that we use the midpoint method to calculate the percentage changes so that the following conclusions are consistent regardless of any price change of B. If  CED is greater than 0, then product A and product B are substitutes because when the price of B increases, quantity demanded of A increases. The greater the CED, the more the substitutability. If CED is less than 0, then product A and product B are compliments because when the price of B increases, the quantity demanded of A decreases. The less the CED, the more complimented they are to each other. If CED is equal to 0, then product A and B are not related. With the concept of elasticity, we are now able to  quantify our definition of substitutes and compliments.

Given a product A, when we plot the demand curve and the supply curve of product A together, the two curves should intersect based on the law of demand and the law of supply. The intersection is called market equilibrium. This is the place where the supply meets the demand exactly. Why would we call it an equilibrium? This is because when the market price is less than the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded will be greater than the quantity supplied (i.e. the market has a shortage of product A). So the comsumers may be willing to pay more in order to get product A, which raises the market price. Seeing the market price go up, the producer will produce more and the consumers demand less. The price may go up and become greater than the equilibrium price, now we have more quantity supplied than demanded. So producers may need  to lower the price in order to sell out the product A they have, which drops the market price. The market price may continue flopping until it sort of converges at the equilibrium price. When reaching the equilibrium price, producers will supply an equilibrium quantity of product A which are all demanded. Please remember that an equilibrium may not exist and there are ways to move the equilibrium point. The market equilibrium is denoted as (equilibrium price, equilibrium quantity).

Let's say now the market price of product A is at the equilibrium price. For those consumers who want product A badly, they are going to be very happy. Why? Because they are willing to pay more than the current market price to own product A and now they don't need to. How to measure their "happiness" or economic benefit here? Here is the formula: sum of (the money they would need to pay - the market price) \* the amount of product A they buy. This number can be visualized as the area under the demand curve  above the market price line (y = equilibrium price in this case) and x is from 0 to the correponding quantity of the price. This area is called the comsumer surplus. The market price can also make some producers happy because they could have only sold the product for a less price. To measure their happiness, we also have a formula: sum of  (the market price - the money they could have only made) \* the amount of product A they produce. This can be visualized as the area above the supply curve below the market price line, x is from 0 to the corresponding quantity. This area is called the producer surplus. The sum of producer surplus and the consumer surplus is the total surplus. If the market price is at the equilibrium price, then the total surplus is maximized. Otherwise the market will have a deadweight loss, making the total surplus smaller than the maximum value. When the marketbequilibrium is reached, we say the market reaches allocative efficacy.

The change of demand and or supply may change the market equilibrium. The factors are listed above.

Sometimes the market trend is going against the will of consumers or producers, they turn to the government, pressuring them to "change" the market trend. The government will need to do some price controls and quantity controls.

Price controls come in two flavors: price ceilings and price floors. Price ceilings set a ceiling of maximum market price. Price floors set a minimum market price for some goods or services. A binding/effective price ceiling is "below" the equilibrium price, in this case a shortage will result. A binding/effective price floor is "above" the equilibrium price, in this case a surplus/excess supply will result.

The government can also do a quantity control to restrict the maximum number of quantity supplied (quota).

Not only can government do price and quality control, it can also do taxation to generate income for itself. The government can impose a tax on either producers or consumers. If a tax is imposed on producers, the supply curve left shifts. If a tax is imposed on consumers, the supply curve left shifts.

Another type of tax is tariff. When a country opens its market to the world. The market equilibrium of the world changes, and the new equilibrium price will be the product's new market price in the country. If the domestic equilibrium price is higher than the new market price, then the country's producers produce less and the country imports the product from other countries to feed the excess demand. If the domestic equilibrium price is lower than the new market price, the country's producers produce more and the country exports the excess products to feed other countries. Importing goods makes domestic producers produce less than before, so they make less money, some of them may not survive. To protect the industry, the government can impose a tariff on importing that good, making the price higher so that domestic producers can produce more and the country imports less. (the new domestic demand - the new domestic supply) \* tariff is the government's income from imposing a tariff.

At the end of this section, I would like to point out that we can view the demand curve as marginal benefit curve and the supply curve as opportunity cost (marginal cost) curve

<br>

### Section Three: Production, cost, and perfect competition

In the basic economic concept, we talked about how production works. To reproduce a resource, we provide land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship as input and expect the resource as output. Here we formally define this production process as a function F(a,b,c,…), where a,b,c are resources that fall into the four categories of resources, F(a,b,c,…) gives you a total product.

Suppose we have F(a,b,c), we fix b and c and keep a variable. We can derive marginal product on a, which tells you the total product of one incremental unit of a. We can also derive the average product on a, which is equal to F(a,b,c) / a.

There are two types of production: short-run production and long-run production. Short-run means there is at least one input that remains steady. Whereas long-run means every input is variable. Let's first focus on short-run production.

For short-run production, since we have some input remain steady, we are going to have a fixed cost. The input that remain variable contribute to the variable cost. Total cost is equal to fixed cost + variable cost. To determine the number of product we produce, we need to maximize the profit we are going to get. So we look at the difference between marginal revenue and the marginal total cost for a clue. If the difference is 0 at a certain amount say X and will become negative if we continue to increase production, then we know this is the maximum profit we can make, which is equal to the marginal revenue \* X - average total cost \* X. Why? Assume the market price is fixed and you are confident enough to sell out all your products. If we charge a price higher than the market price people will buy the cheaper product so you end up having no revenue. If you charge a price lower than the market price, you are going to earn less because you could have earned more. So we will charge the market price. Now we look at the the quantity we should produce. Since the price is fixed, the marginal revenue is fixed, but normally our marginal cost increases as the amount of production increases. This is because the marginal productivity normally decreases as we increase our input. So the difference between marginal revenue and marginal total cost will become smaller and smaller as we produce more and more products. And we should stop producing when the difference becomes 0 and negative if we continue.

It's easy to determine the marginal revenue, which is the market price for one product. To determine marginal cost, we need to compute (the change of cost / the change of production), which is different from the definition we saw in previous chapters. To measure the performance of our production function, we introduce some new features. Here are they:

*   Average total cost (ATC): total cost / total product
*   Average fixed cost (AFC): fixed cost / total product
*   Average variable cost (AVC): variable cost / total product

There is a very interesting conclusion you can draw from the graph of ATC and marginal cost (MC): If MC curve is lower than the ATC curve, that means ATC is decreasing, if MC equals ATC, then ATC is at its lowest, if MC curve is higher than ATC, then ATC is increasing.

The MC, ATC and AVC curves can provide informations about if you should enter or exit a business:

*   If price (i.e. marginal revenue) line is above ATC, the market attracts entrants in the long run and firms will stay in the market in the short-run.
*   If price is equal to ATC, then the market will not attract entrants. But the company will stay, they are neutral about leaving the business in the long run.
*   If price line is lower than ATC but above AVC, then you can continue in the short-run, hoping that the fixed price can be lowered in the near future. If you anticipated that your ATC will always be greater than price, then you should leave the industry. (Well this is the place where I'm confused. Should look for some other materials that support it.)
*   If the price line is lower than AVC curve, you should close your business immediately because there is no way you can make money from the business. If it continues to be the case in the long-run, you should leave the industry.

Short run cost curves can be converted to a long run cost curve. In fact, long run cost curve is the curve that connects the lowest data point on all possible short run cost curves.

The long run cost curve can give us the following information:

*   When the long run cost curve is decreasing, we are experiencing increasing returns to scale (or economies to scale), this means that when we scaled up our input we get more efficient production.
*   When the curve is flat, we are experiencing constant returns to scale, whixh means we are most efficient here. The minimum quantity of production to reach this stage is called minimum economies of scale (MES).
*   When the curve is increasing, we reach the stage of decreading returns to scale (diseconomies to scale), which means when we scaled up we get less efficient production.

The difference between MES and the current quantity demanded of the market can tell you the market concentration. If MES is much smaller than the quantity demanded of the market, then the market is fragmented because many competitors can achieve MES and earn their market share. If MES is close to or even greater than the quantity demanded of the market, then few competitors can make. The competitors who make it to MES can have a command of the market and hence become monopoly.

Markets have competitions. Let's first look at a simple competition model: perfect competition. A perfect competition has the following properties:

*   Multiple sellers and buyers
*   Identical products/services
*   Perfect information: everyone gets the same market information
*   No barriers for entry/exit the market
*   Market price will be the market equilibrium price.

There are two types of perfect competitions. One is cost constant perfect competition, meaning that the firms entering in the market have the same cost structure (i.e. having the same MC and ATC curves).  The other is cost variable perfect competition.

In cost constant perfect competition, this scenario will always happen. At first the firms are making economic profit from the market, which attracts more entrants. As more entrants enter the market, the market supply curve right shifts (because the firms have the same cost structure), which yields a lower market equilibrium price until firms have economic loss. Firms now are having economic loss and will later exit the market because they run out of their resources, so the supply curve left shifts until every firm is making economic profit. And thus it becomes the beginning of this scenario. This scenario will not stop until every firm in the market makes 0 economic profit. This will stop firms from entering or exiting the market. So we can say on the long run, if the cost is constant, then the long run supply curve will be a flat line. And the equilibrum price will be equal to the marginal and average total cost.

If the cost goes up when new firms enter the market, eventually the above scenario will stop at a higher price, which will give us an upward-sloping long run supply curve. Similarly, if the cost goes down when new firms enter the market, we will have a downward-sloping long term supply curve.

### Section Four: Imperfect Competition

Apart from perfect competition, we also have imperfect competition where the market does not have all the attributes that a perfect competition has. In this case each firm will have a separate demand and supply curve and the price of the product of one firm is no longer the market equilibrium price. A firm can have a different price scheme under different quantity to be sold based on its demand curve, yielding a different MR curve which may not be equal to the price. This is one of the differences between imperfect competition and perfect competition. In perfect competition, the MR curve will be a flat line, the price will always be the equilibrium price of the market. This is beacuse if a company raises price, it gets no sales. If it lowers the price, it is not maximizing its profit, which is against the assumption of profit maximization. If one company lowers the price, other companies will follow, so the company cannot get all the sales by lowering the price. So companies will end up charging the equilibrium price. But in an imperfect competition, each firm sells a different product of the same type, which means they only need to worry about their products' demand. And they can charge price based on the demand curve and produce the quantity where MC = MR.

Here, the price is greater than MC because it can be proven that MR curve is trending down 2x faster than the Demand curve. So we will end up having a deadweight loss which is equal to the area where Price > MC > MR. The reason of having a deadweight loss here is that it is not rational to produce here so we will not produce anything but we can still earn some money if we keep on producing here. So we end up leaving this profit here. Because we have deadweight loss here, the quantity the producer produces is not efficient.

Let's dive into some types of imperfect competitions. First type of imperfect competition we are going to talk about is monopoly. Monopoly has the following attributes:

*   One seller and multiple buyers
*   Insurmountable barrier to enter the market

With the above attributes we can say that monopolist can set the market price. If MC of the monopolist is decreasing across the demand curve, then we call this a natural monopoly. Because it is very hard to enter the market, if the monopolist is making economic profit here, it will still be making the same amount of economic profit in the long run.

Given a monopoly market or a monoplistic competition, we can also do what's called price discrimination to earn more profit. We can set a higher price for a small amount of your product, make some minor changes which does not change the cost and put on a fancy name on it (e.g. Pro, Pro Max, etc) and sell a higher price. The reason behind this strategy is that we can derive from the demand curve that the first few amount of product has a high marginal benefit, even if we charge it a relatively higher price there will still be customers who are willing to pay for it. If we are able to charge every customer at his or her willingness to pay for the product, then the marginal revenue curve will be the same as the demand curve and so we don't have deadweight loss in this case. This is called perfect prixe discrimination.

Another type of imperfect competition is monopolistic competition. In this case, there are no barriers for entering the market. And firms have monopoly on their own product, meaning that the product they produce differentiates with each other. One interesting thing to point out is that in the long run the economic profit of a firm will be 0. This is because when one product takes over the market, other companies learn and come up with similar product with different advantages, which will left shift the dominating product's demand curve and right shifts the subatitites' demand curve, making economic profit 0 for all of the companies in the long run.

There are two interesting terms I would like to address. The first term is allocative efficiency, meaning that firms choose to produce the quantity of products where MC = Demand. The second term is productive efficiency, where products are produced at the lowest ATC. The last term is excess capacity, meaning that quantity of a product to be produced is smaller than the quantity that reaches productively efficiency. Perfect competition has both allocatively and productive efficiency in the long run. Imperfect competition don't have allocative efficiency and have excess capacity when they don't have perfect price discrimination. They will have allocative efficiency and excess capacity when they have perfect price discrimination.

There is another type of imperfect competition called oligopoly. It describes a market where there are only few suppliers. These suppliers can cooperate (collude) to form a cartel which act like a monopoly or compete fiercely. Since the number of suppliers are small, companies can use game theory to deside on their next move. They can draw out a payoff matrix, find their dominant strategy take it if there is any. There are two scenarios worth pointing out. When conpetitors pick their dominant strategies and have a suboptimal outcome for all of them, we call it the Prisoners' Dilemma. If there is a state where no one can gain profit from swtiching to a different strategy, then the state is called Nash Equilibrium.

<br>

### Section Five: Factor Market

With the knowledge we have for demand and supply of a product, we can apply the same principles to production factors.

Let's look at labor market. We can use the law of supply to describe the relationship between marginal revenue product of labor (marginal revenue \* marginal product of labor) and the quantity of labor or the relationship between wage and quantity of labor. And we can use the law of demand to describe the relationship between wages and quantity of labor.

Factors that can shift the supply of labor:

*   Immigration
*   Minimum retire age
*   Labor preference
*   Wage of another market

Factors that can shift the demand of labor:

*   Demand of the product
*   Productivity

For a firm to employ the optimal number of labor, it should employ the exact quantity of labor where marginal factor cost (wage) is equal to marginal revenue product of labor.

The equilibrium wage of the supply and demand of labor determines the marginal factor cost of a firm in a perfectly competitive labor market.

If we have more money to spare, we would like to decide on which input factor we should invest on. We will use a greedy strategy similar to when we make purchase decisions. We compute (marginal revenue product of that factor)/(the cost per unit of that factor), always pick the factor that has the smallest value until all the values are the same. That way we can maximize our productivity (or minimize the cost achieving the same productivity).

The labor market is not always perfectly competitive, sometime there is only one employer and you have many labor. This is called a monopsony labor market. In this market, the employer can be the price setter.It's worth pointing out that the marginal factor cost curve has twice as large as the slope of the labor suuply curve. In a perfectly competitive market, the wage should be the point where labor supply curve intersects the marginal product revenue of labor curve (the wage at this point is called the competitive wage). But right now the wage will be smaller than the competitive wage.

To help workers earn more money, the government can put forward a minimum wage greater than the market wage for the monopsony market. With the minimum wage, the marginal factor cost curve will be a flat line until the line intercepts the marginal revenue product of labor curve. The marginal factor cost curve will be the same as the original curve after the interception. If the minimum wage line is lower than the interception between the marginal revenue product curve, it can also help more workers get employed.

### Section Six: Market Failure and the Role of Government

Previously when we talk about supply and demand we only focus on the market. In fact we can factor in social cost and/or benefit and shift the demand and supply and introduce deadweight loss (i.e. introduce inefficiency).

When buying a product benefits a society, we say the product has positive social externality. This can be added to the marginal benefit and right shifts the marginal benefit curve (i.e. demand curve). If the producers continue to produce the original amount of product, then we end up not maximizing the consumer surplus, which introduces deadweight loss.

When producing a product damages the environment (generates cost for the society), we say this product has a negative social externality. This cam be added to the marginal cost curve and thus left shifts the margonal cost curve (i.e. supply curve). If the producers continue to prpduce the original amount of product, then we end up losing some total surplus, which introduces deadweight loss.

The government needs to encourage the producers to internalize the social cost and benefits in their decision making to eliminate deadweight loss. For positive externalities, the government can subsidize comsumers in a per unit basis, For negarive externalities, the government can impose a per-unit tax on producers.

Another type of inefficiency is called "the tragedy of commons". If there is no restriction on the use of a public resource, people will have huge incentive to overuse the resource and deplete it. The huge incentive exists because they can claim all the benefits in the short run but the cost will be spread among them and the future generations. And someone stops abusing the resource doesn't stop others from abusing the resource. The government can tackle this problem by selling permits to the users or sell this public property to a private owner.

But how do we define common goods? Common goods are defined as rival but not excludable goods, meaning that when someone is using a common good, others cannot use it. And if you don't use it, you can't stop others from using it (e.g. public fish pond).

There are other kinds of goods when we use rivalry and excludability to define goods. A private good is rival and excludable (e.g. an iPhone you bought); an artificially scarce good is not rival but excludable (e.g. YouTube membership); a public good is neither rival nor excludable (e.g. air).

The last thing we want to talk about here is income inequality. It is obviousbthatvnot everyone has the same annual income. But how "unfair" is the income distribution? If we have a 2D graph that depicts the cumulative percentage of total income of all citizens versus the cumulative percentage of the population, we end up having a Lorenz curve. Idealy, if total income is equally distributed, mean each 1% of the population has 1% of the total income, we will have a lorenz curve of a straight line where y = x drew on the 2D graph. The area under line y=x and above the lorenz curve will be the Gini coefficient which measures the inequality of income distribution. If total income is distributed  perfectly equally in an economy, the Gini coefficient will be 0. If total income is distributed perfectly inequally, the Gini coefficient will be 1. We use Gini coefficient to compare income inequalities in different countries in the world.

There are a few ways to reduce Gini coefficient:

*   Using a progressive tax system which tax rich people at a higher rate rather than regressive tax system which tax poor people at a higher rate;
*   Expanding access to financial markets to all citizensbso that peoplenhave the same opportunity to make money from financial market theoratically;
